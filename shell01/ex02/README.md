The find command in Linux is a powerful tool that allows you to search for 
files and directories in a specific directory or the entire file system. 
The exec function of the find command can be used to execute a command on 
the files that are found by the find command. The exec function of the 
find command has various options that you can use to customize the 
behavior of the command. Here are some of the commonly used options:

{} - This option is used to represent the file or directory that is found 
by the find command. You can use this option to pass the found file or 
directory to the command that you want to execute.

+ - This option is used to terminate the command that you want to execute. 
This option is similar to using a semicolon ; at the end of the command.

\; - This option is used to terminate the command that you want to 
execute. This option is similar to using a semicolon ; at the end of the 
command, but it is escaped with a backslash \.

\+ - This option is used to terminate the command that you want to 
execute. This option is similar to using a plus + at the end of the 
command, but it is escaped with a backslash \.

; - This option is used to separate the commands that you want to execute. 
You can use this option to execute multiple commands on the files that are 
found by the find command.

-ok - This option is similar to the -exec option, but it asks for 
confirmation before executing the command.

-depth - This option is used to perform a depth-first search. This means 
that the find command will search the subdirectories of a directory before 
it searches the directory itself.

-maxdepth - This option is used to limit the depth of the search. You can 
specify the maximum depth of the search using this option.

Note that the command can be any shell command (rm, grep, cp, mv... etc)

These are some of the commonly used options of the exec function of the 
find command in Linux. There are many other options that you can use to 
customize the behavior of the command. You can refer to the find command's 
man page for a complete list of options.


In the command line: 

find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec basename -s .sh {} \;

This is a command that can be run in a Unix-like shell, such as Bash. It 
will find all files in the current directory (and its subdirectories) that 
have the extension ".sh", and then extract the basename (i.e., the file 
name without the directory path or extension) of each file.

Here is a breakdown of the command:

find: This is a command that searches for files and directories in a 
directory hierarchy.
.: This specifies the starting directory for the search. In this case, it 
is the current directory.
-type f: This specifies that only regular files should be included in the 
search, not directories or other types of files.
-name "*.sh": This specifies that only files with the extension ".sh" 
should be included in the search.
-exec: This specifies that a command should be executed on each file that 
matches the search criteria.
basename: This is a command that outputs the basename of a file path.
-s .sh: This option specifies that the extension ".sh" should be removed 
from the end of the filename.
{}: This is a placeholder for the file path that is being processed.
\;: This specifies the end of the -exec command.
So, when this command is run, it will find all files in the current 
directory and its subdirectories that have the extension ".sh", and for 
each file, it will output the basename of the file without the ".sh" 
extension.
